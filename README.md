## Project Overview
This project is designed to address the critical issues of maternal and child nutrition in Indonesia, particularly the problem of stunting among infants due to malnutrition. We have developed an application that leverages AI and blockchain technology to provide personalized nutritional guidance tailored to the needs and economic conditions of pregnant women and children.

### Key Features
- **Personalized Nutritional Plans:** Daily meal plans generated by AI, customized to each user's nutritional needs and economic situation.
- **Real-Time Adjustments:** The application updates meal plans daily based on user input to ensure ongoing, relevant nutritional advice.
- **Local Pricing Integration:** Ingredient prices are tailored to the Indonesian market to ensure affordability.
- **Blockchain-Powered Security:** Decentralized AI (DeAI) using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) for enhanced transparency and security.
